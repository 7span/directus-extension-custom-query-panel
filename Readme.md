-   Need to setup table with relational field for queries
-   `collection` field contains table name to select relational field data
-   `fields` will contain table columns to display data
-   `custom-query` endpoint will be given id of selected record.
-   `Relational field name` should contain name `query` in table. ( it is currently static )
